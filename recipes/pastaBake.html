        <p>A pasta bake is a warm, oven-baked dish made by mixing cooked pasta with sauce,<br> 
            cheese, and other ingredients like meat or vegetables. It’s baked until bubbly <br>
            and golden, creating a comforting and flavorful meal.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz mostaccioli or similar pasta</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 chopped onion</li>
            <li>28 oz spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>4 oz canned mushrooms, drained</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325F or 165C. Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. <br>
                Stir in mostaccioli and return to a boil. Cook mostaccioli uncovered, <br>

                Drain well.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook ground beef and onion in a skillet over medium heat until browned.</li>

                beef mixture in a large bowl; transfer to the prepared casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until very hot, about 20 minutes.</li>
